<span id="prop-noun1-field"></span> and <span id="prop-noun2-field"></span> went on a vacation to <span id="place-field"></span>. Once there, they were overjoyed to find a(n) <span id="adj1-field"></span> <span id="noun1-field"></span>. 
But disaster struck when their old nemisis, _prop-noun3_, took the _noun1_ from right under their noses and even _past-tense-verb_ to mock them. 
Our hero's could not take this insult lightly! 
_prop-noun1_ took chase on foot while _prop-noun2_ got into a _adj2_ _vehichle1_. _prop-noun3_ ran off fast, but not fast enough. 
_prop-noun2_ ran _propnoun3_ over with the _vehichle1_. Before they could get up _prop-noun1_ smashed _prop-noun3_'s _body-part_ in. 
_prop-noun3_ tried to _verb2_ but couldn't fing the strength.
Victory! _prop-noun1_ and _prop-noun2_ could finally enjoy their vacation and hard won _noun1_ in peace.
...
Off in the distance, however, _prop-noun3_ struggles up. 
With a renewed sense of _feeling-noun_, _prop-noun3 then get themselves a _adj3_ cybernetic _body-part_ and begin their plans of vengence.
The _noun1_ won't be safe for long!
